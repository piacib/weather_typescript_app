# Weather

## How I worked on this project

-

## How to navigate this project

- [image-sprite](public/icons/static/weather-sprite.svg)
- [custom geolocation hook](src/hooks/useGeolocation.ts)
- [custom wether data hook](src/hooks/useWeatherFetch.ts)

## Why I built the project this way

- I chose to not use a state management library such as Redux on purpose
- I used Typescript for this project because of its increasing prevalence in the front end web community and the benefit of quickly finding errors in code when they are changed down the line

## If I had more time I would change this

- Add user settings to adjust the window size and display
- Add testing
- Add an eventlistener to automatically update pokemon data every move

## Installation and usage
